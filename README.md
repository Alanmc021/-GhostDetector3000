# 👻 GhostDetector3000

**GhostDetector3000** is a fun application that captures an image using your webcam and, through simple OpenCV processing, draws rectangles around "ghosts" and "humans" with random ages. All of this without using any real AI… or is it? 😱

## 📸 How It Works?

1. The script uses JavaScript to capture a photo through the browser webcam.
2. The image is processed with OpenCV in Google Colab.
3. Two rectangles are drawn on the image: one for a "ghost" and another for a "human."
4. Random ages are assigned, just to add a touch of mystery.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- OpenCV 👀  
- Google Colab 💻  
- JavaScript 🎭  
- PIL (Pillow) 🖼️  

## 🚀 How to Run?

1. Open Google Colab.  
2. Copy and paste the script into a new notebook.  
3. Run all the cells.  
4. Look at the camera and witness the magic happen! 🎩✨  

## 📷 Example Output

Here’s an example of how the program works:

## 🤡 A Prank?

If you’ve read this far and are wondering, "Does this actually detect ghosts?" Well… there’s only one way to find out. Run the code and see for yourself! 👀  

⚠️ **Warning**: If a "ghost" appears in the image and you're alone… run. 🏃💨
